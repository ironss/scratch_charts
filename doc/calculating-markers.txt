To add fix markers to a chart
=============================

* calculate how far apart markers should be, considering
  * the pixel resolution of the chart
  * the distance between chart and viewer

* From the track, calculate the major trackpoints, choosing them to be
  * on rounded time value
  * not too close together

* Project the trackpoints onto the chart coordinate system
  * keep the label (eg. time, speed, distance)

* Draw the fix marker symbol and label text onto the chart


To calculate size of 1 NM in pixels
===================================

On a Mercator projection chart, the scale is not fixed. However, for the
small scratch charts, it is sufficient to give the scale at the
centre of the chart.

* Find the midpoint of the chart in projected coordinates.

   midx_px = chart.width_px / 2
   midy_px = chart.height_px / 2
   
   x0 = chart.origin.x + midx_px
   y0 = chart.origin.y + midy_px

* Find the coordinates of the midpoint
   
   long0, lat0 = gdal_transform(s_srs=<chart>, t_srs=EPS:4326, x0, y0)

* Find the coordinates of the ends of a vertical line, 1 NM in length. 1 NM
  is 1/60 of a degree

     long1, lat1 = long0, lat0 - 0.5*1/60
     long2, lat2 = long0, lat0 + 0.5*1/60

* Find the projected coordinates of the endpoints of the measured mile.

     x1, y1 = gdal_transform(s_srs=EPSG:4326, t_srs=<chart>, long1, lat1)
     x2, y2 = gdal_transform(s_srs=EPSG:4326, t_srs=<chart>, long2, lat2)

* Draw the line on the chart.
